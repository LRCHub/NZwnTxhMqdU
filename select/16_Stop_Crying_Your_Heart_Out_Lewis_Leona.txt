Hold up
Hold on

Don't be scared

You'll never change what's been and gone
May your smile
Shine on

Don't be scared

Your destiny may keep you warm

'Cause all of the stars have faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

Get up (Get up)
Come on (Come on)
Why you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change what's been and gone

'Cause all of the stars have faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

Where all of the stars have faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

(When all of your stars) were faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
Stop crying your heart out

Stop crying your heart out
Stop (Crying your heart out), stop now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Stop crying your heart out
Ah, ooh, ooh, oh
